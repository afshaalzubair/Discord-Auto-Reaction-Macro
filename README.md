# Discord-Auto-Reaction-Macro

This program is intended to automatically scroll and react to discord messages with a specific emoji (in this case, the flushed emoji), however it most likely does not work properly.
If it does work, it will only work on discord desktop with dark theme. 
Press G if you want it to stop.
